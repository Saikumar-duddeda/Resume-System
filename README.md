**AI-Powered Resume Builder & Manager**
**Project Overview**
The project is a full-stack web app to enable students and professionals to build, manage, and optimize resumes in an efficient manner. It involves a responsive, modern frontend, a powerful backend API, AI-driven automation, and integration with hackathons, internships, and online learning sites. Users can develop dynamic resumes, import PDF/DOCX files, create downloadable PDFs, and get AI-driven feedback to enhance their resumes.
The system is designed to provide a next-generation resume environment where professional experience and expertise are updated in real-time automatically, allowing users to easily maintain top-notch resumes.

**Key Features**

User Authentication: Secure registration/login with hashed passwords and JWT-based authentication. Only authenticated users can edit or create resumes.
Resume Management: Create resumes with organized sections like personal details, education, experience, projects, and skills.
Multi-Template Support: Select various resume templates for various styles and layouts.
File Import & Export: Import existing PDFs/DOCX resumes, extract structured content, and export professional PDFs.
AI-Powered Automation: Auto-create professional summaries, skill analysis, and offer AI recommendations for resume enhancement.
Integration with Achievements: Automatically sync achievements from hackathons, internships, and online courses.
Cross-Platform Support: Fully responsive design with support for desktop and mobile browsers.

**Tech Stack
Frontend**

React 18 – Single-page application for dynamic and responsive UI.
React Router – Client-side routing between pages such as dashboard and builder.
Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling for quick UI development.
CRACO – Webpack configuration customization (aliasing, build hacks).
Radix UI, Lucide, Sonner – UI components, icons, and toast notifications.
Axios – HTTP client for making calls to backend APIs.
Other libraries: react-hook-form, zod, date-fns, embla for forms, validation, and utilities.

**Backend**

Node.js + Express / FastAPI – API server for CRUD, auth, and integrations.
MongoDB – Store users, resumes, achievements, and skills.
JWT & bcrypt – Token-based secure auth and password hashing.
PDF/DOCX Processing: PyPDF2, python-docx, ReportLab for file parsing and creating PDFs.
AI Integration: Pre-trained NLP model or OpenAI API for resume summaries and scoring.
python-dotenv – Load environment variables in a secure way.

**Project Approach**

Requirement Analysis: Determined key user requirements – safe resume development, support for multiple templates, AI feedback, and accomplishment integration
Modular Architecture: Divided frontend, backend, AI module, and external integrations to ease development and future scalability.
Feature Implementation: Implemented authentication, dynamic resume templates, PDF/DOCX import/export, AI-based summaries, and real-time changes.
Integration & Automation: Integrated external platforms (hackathons, internships) to automatically update resume fields
Testing & Deployment: Tested multi-template rendering, file management, AI insights, and secure authentication. Hosted frontend on Vercel and backend on Render/Fly.io/Docker.

**Workflow**

User registers/login → JWT token is issued.
User creates or imports a resume → auto-populated structured fields.
AI module creates summaries and suggestions.
Achievements from hackathons, internships, or courses are automatically synced.
User chooses a template → resumes exported as downloadable PDF.
Resume dynamically updates as new data or achievements are incorporated.

**Technical Complexities**

Frontend-Backend Sync: Live updates with multiple templates and dynamic content.
File Parsing: Reliable extraction from PDF/DOCX maintaining structure.
AI Integration: Async processing of NLP summaries and skill analysis.
External API Integration: Retrieving and validating achievements from third-party platforms.
Deployment: CRACO builds for Vercel, environment variable handling, serverless backend considerations.
Scalability: Modular architecture enables adding new templates, AI features, or external integrations with minimal effort.
